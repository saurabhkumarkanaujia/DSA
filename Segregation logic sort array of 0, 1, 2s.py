#Array consist of only 0's, 1's and 2's. Write an algorithm to sort  this array in O(n) time complexity and O(1) Space complexity with only one traversal Asked in : : Amazon, Microsoft, Adobe, WalmartLabs

#Modify array so that it becomes : [0 0 1 1 2 2]
#Hint1 : You are not suppose to use any extra space
#Hint2 : You need change the same array with single traversal with O(n) time complexity
